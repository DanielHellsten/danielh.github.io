        <p>The red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas), a native of the tropical  
            lowlands extending from southern Mexico to northern South America, 
             is a favorite for its remarkable adaptations. Its bulging red eyes 
             are its telltale feature, but it is also known for its neon-green body, 
             accented with vertical blue and yellow stripes on the sides  
             and bright orange or reddish feet. It is thought that when startled,
            or reddish feet. It is thought that when startled, the red-eyed tree frog

            and thereby enabling its escape. confusing its predators ability,   
            too, which earned it the nickname “monkey frog.” Its huge webbed feet, 
            which are equipped with sticky pads, provide a secure grip as it leaps 
           and climbs among the trees.
